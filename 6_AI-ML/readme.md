# GCP - Machine Learning

Google Cloud includes a number of services which are frequently used when building machine learning experiments and applications.  I've created a visualization to summarize most common usage below. Also, see the folded named `gemini_LLM` in this repo to view my notes and visualization of the recently released VertexAI Model Garden (which includes Google's LLM Gemini).

## Course

This repo is a companion to my LinkedIn Learning course 'GCP ML Essentials' - at https://www.linkedin.com/learning/google-cloud-platform-for-machine-learning-essential-training

This Repo section contains information and code samples/notebooks which use GCP Machine Learning / AI services.  

- In this Repo: GCP AI example notebooks &  scripts in folders in this repository
- GCP Repo: Big repo of many VertexAI samples (instructions and notebooks): https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-samples
