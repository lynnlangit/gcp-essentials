List of prompts

Vertex AI services
- list core GCP Vertex AI Machine Learning services for machine learning model building and key associated use cases in a table
- Generate a table which compares capabilities of GCP BigQuery Machine Learning to those available in GCP Vertex AI AutoML

TensorFlow
- what is TensorFlow?
- what is the mnist sample TensorFlow example?
- Generate a table which lists key integrations between the open source machine learning library TensorFlow and GCP Vertex AI machine learning services

Notebooks 
- Generate a table which lists key integrations between the open source machine learning library TensorFlow and GCP Vertex AI machine learning services
- what is the mnist sample TensorFlow example?
- Generate the Python code for a TensorFlow example using the mnist dataset.  The example should be simple to run using one or more GCP VertexAI notebooks.
- Create a comprehensive table comparing the features, use cases, costs, and key considerations of the following GCP Vertex AI Jupyter Notebook services:
          Managed Instance
          Managed Notebooks
          User-Managed Notebooks
          Colab Enterprise
          Ensure the table includes the following information:
          
          Setup (Google-managed or user-managed)
          Environment (pre-configured or customizable)
          Compute (dedicated or shared)
          Autoscaling (yes or no)
          GPU support (yes or no)
          Permissions (IAM)
          Cost structure (pay per instance, pay per usage, pay per VM, or per-user license)
          Example use cases for each service type
          Key considerations for cost optimization
          Present the information in a clear and concise format, using a table structure for easy comparison.
          
          Additionally, provide a brief overview of the key points for each service, highlighting their strengths and ideal use cases.
