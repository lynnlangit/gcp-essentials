## Topic Areas

Google Cloud Platform Analytics and Machine Learning Samples for services shown below.  

![GCP ML](/images/gcp-ml.png)

Samples currently include the following:
 - **GCP Colabs** (Jupyter-style) notebook (example shown below)
    - for BigQuery (connect & run SQL queries)
    - for BigQueryML (connect, build, train and predict using ML model) IMPORTANT: Use link in each notebook to open it in GCP Colabs environment
    - for TensorFlow w/GPU - speed test  
    - for production workloads, you may want to pay for and use ColabPro ($10/mo) for faster GPU, longer notebook runtimes and more memory
