# Vertex AI Pipelines on GCP

AI Pipelines are now called Vertex AI Pipelines.  From Google's documentation: *"Vertex AI Pipelines lets you automate, monitor, and govern your machine learning (ML) systems in a serverless manner by using ML pipelines to orchestrate your ML workflows. You can batch run ML pipelines defined using the Kubeflow Pipelines (Kubeflow Pipelines) or the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) framework."*
