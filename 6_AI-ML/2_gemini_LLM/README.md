## What is Gemini LLM?

Google Gemini is a large language model that can be used for a variety of tasks, including text generation, text classification, text summarization, text translation, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, image captioning, image classification, image generation, image-to-text, video captioning, video classification, video generation, video-to-text, and multimodal tasks.  

### Versions of Google Gemini

Google Gemini is available in three versions: Nano, Pro or Ultra. Nano is the smallest version of Gemini, and is designed for use on mobile devices. Pro is the most powerful version of Gemini, and is designed for use on desktop computers. Ultra is the most powerful version of Gemini, and is designed for use on servers.

### Example Jupyter Notebook for Google Gemini LLM

The following Jupyter Notebook is an example of how to use Google Gemini LLM for text generation.  It uses the Pro version of Gemini, and shows how to call the API using Python.  It also shows how to use the API to generate text from a prompt.  The notebook can be run in Google Colab, or on a local machine with Python 3 installed.
