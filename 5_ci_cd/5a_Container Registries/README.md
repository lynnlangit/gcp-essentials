## GCP Registries

GCP includes two registries - Artifact Registry and Container Registry.  The [linked article](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/artifact-registry-is-ga) and graphic (shown below) summarizes feature differences.

From the GCP docs..."*As the **evolution of Container Registry**, Artifact Registry is a single place for your organization to manage container images and language packages (such as docker, maven and npm)...it is designed to be simple to integrate it with your CI/CD tooling to set up automated pipelines.*"
