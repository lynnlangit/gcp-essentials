# My GCP Essentials Course Scripts, Links and Examples

This repository contains sample code, links and scripts for working with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. Included technologies are for storage, database, big data and more.  This repository is designed to be used in conjunction with these LinkedIn Learning courses: 

- 📚 **"GCP Essentials"** - [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/google-cloud-platform-essential-training-for-administrators-22141609) to course. This course is also named **"Google Cloud Platform Essential Training for Administrators"**
- 📚 **"GCP Enterprise Essentials"** - [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/google-cloud-platform-for-enterprise-essential-training-22140980) to course
- 📚 **"GCP Machine Learning Essentials"** - [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/google-cloud-platform-for-machine-learning-essential-training) to course
- 📚 **'GCP Tools'** - [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-google-cloud-developer-and-devops-tools) to course & associated updates into this repo --> example in `tools` folder at [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-essentials/tree/master/0_setup_and_iam_and_costs/tools)
- 📚 **'GCP Cost Control'** course on [LI_L](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/google-cloud-controlling-cost), and associated Repo page at -  [link](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-essentials/tree/master/0_setup_and_iam_and_costs/0c_cost_control)

Examples use the GPC scripting tools (`gcloud`, `gsutil`, `bq`...) and sometimes also the Python API with the GCP SDK.  You can work with GCP services in many programming langauges, such as Java, Go, Node and others. See this link for the GCP SDK to see examples for other programming languages: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/  


## Other GCP Repos & Courses

Additionally, I have created other reporisitories and courses on GCP topics.  These artifacts contains sample code and scripts for working with Google Cloud Platform services for bioinformatics use cases, machine learning, Apache Spark and NoSQL on GCP.  

- 📚 **GCP-ML** --> LIL_L course - for code samples for GCP machine learning see this [the ML/AI section](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-essentials/tree/master/6_AI-ML) of this repository
- :octocat: **GCP-for-Bioinformatics** --> Open source course - for links, screencasts, jupyter notebooks or example workflows (Terra/WDL, Nextflow/NF, Galaxy Project...) for bioinformatics use cases, see this repository: https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-for-bioinformatics

- My Apache Hadoop/Spark and NoSQL courses on LinkedIn Learning (includes lots of GCP info)- [link](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/search?entityType=COURSE&keywords=hadoop%20spark%20langit)
  - 📺 **'Learning Hadoop'** - if you are learning Hadoop/Spark, watch this course first
  - 📺 **'Cloud Hadoop: Scaling Apache Spark'** - uses GCP Dataproc
  - 📺 **'Cloud NoSQL for SQL Pros'** - covers both GCP and AWS NoSQL
