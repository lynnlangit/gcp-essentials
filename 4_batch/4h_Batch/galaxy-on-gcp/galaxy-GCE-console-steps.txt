These are the manual steps to set up your first GCE Virtual Machine w/Galaxy using the Google Cloud console

1. Login in to Google Cloud console with your login (usually your gmail account)
2. Create a GCE Image from 'planemo' base image
     ---set the source to 'galaxyproject_images/planemo_machine_smc.06.image.tar.gz'
     ---create in the GCP zone closest to you
3. Create a GCE instance from your custom image (#2) with these settings
     ---name your instance 'hello-gene'
     ---create in the same GCP zone as you created the custom image in #2
     ---size to 30 GB for the OS disk (default is 10 GB)
     ---enable http/https traffic (off by default, check the check boxes
     ---add a persistant disk of 300 GB for your data (can save even if you delete your GCE instance)
4. CONNECT TO GALAXY on your GCE VM ('hello-gene')
    ----find the public IP of 'hello-gene', open http://<public ip of 'hello-gene'>, you should see Galaxy in your browser
    ----login to Galaxy with Username: planemo and Password: planemo

NOTE: You can pause (stop) your GCE instance when not in use to save money

TIP: to restart Galaxy - SSH to your GCE instance and type 'restart_galaxy' at the prompt
