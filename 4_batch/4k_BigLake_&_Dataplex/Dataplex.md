from the GCP docs *"You can use Dataplex to build a data mesh architecture. The GCP Dataplex service includes features, such as a lake, zones, and assets, to build a data mesh.
A data mesh is an organizational and technical approach that decentralizes data ownership among domain data owners. These owners provide the data as a product in a standard way and facilitate communication among different parts of the 
organization to distribute datasets across different locations."*

## Dataplex and other GCP Services

The relationship between other GCS services (i.e. Cloud Storage, BigQuery...) is complex and key to understanding how to use Dataplex services.  Shown below are two MindMap visualizations I've created to help you to understand these relationships.

## DataPlex Features

 - Search DataMesh data (search across authorized data domains, use metadata in search parameters)

 - Filtered Search (filter search by common parameters, source, type, project, can include search across public BigQuery data too)
